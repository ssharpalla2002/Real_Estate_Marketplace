# Real Estate Marketplace

## Overview

This **Real Estate Marketplace** is built with **React**, **Node.js**, **Express.js**, and **MongoDB**, featuring real-time chat using **Socket.io**. Users can browse property listings, view details, create posts, and communicate in real time.

## Technical Working

The application uses the **MERN stack** with additional tools for enhanced functionality:

- **Backend:** Node.js and Express.js manage API routes, authentication, and database communication.  
- **Database:** MongoDB with **Prisma ORM** for structured data management.  
- **Authentication:** Users are authenticated using **JWT tokens** stored in cookies, with protected routes and middleware.  
- **Frontend:** React.js handles UI components, routing via **React Router DOM**, and state management with **Context API** and **Zustand**.  
- **CRUD Operations:** Users can create, read, update, and delete property posts with dynamic data fetching and loading skeletons.  
- **File Uploads:** Images are uploaded via React and stored through backend endpoints.  
- **Rich Text Editor:** Users can create formatted posts using an integrated text editor.  
- **Real-Time Chat:** Socket.io enables live messaging with auto-scroll and seen notifications.  
- **Responsive Design:** Fully responsive layouts ensure usability across devices.  
- **Additional Features:** Post filtering, dynamic fetching based on URL queries, and interactive UI elements.

The project focuses on **full-stack integration**, secure authentication, real-time communication, and building a professional, interactive web application.
